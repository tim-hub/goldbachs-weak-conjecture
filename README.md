## About
The program is written for verifying Goldbach's Weak Conjecture.
There are just tens of lines code.

## About Goldbach's weak conjecture
In number theory, Goldbach's weak conjecture, also known as the odd Goldbach conjecture, the ternary Goldbach problem, or the 3-primes problem, states that:

    Every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. (A prime may be used more than once in the same sum.) 

## Notice
And ofcourse, I did not solve the conjecture. For this program designed to verify the conjecture when the number is below *Max* that the number you input.

## For Example:
When I input 10 as the max number or it can be called the stop point number,
The output:

```
Firstly, input a max number to prove the three odds:
33
 from 1 to 33, all prime numbers are in the list:
 [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]
 9=1+1+7, Conjecture on number 9 is true
 11=1+3+7, Conjecture on number 11 is true
 13=1+1+11, Conjecture on number 13 is true
 15=1+1+13, Conjecture on number 15 is true
 17=1+3+13, Conjecture on number 17 is true
 19=1+1+17, Conjecture on number 19 is true
 21=1+1+19, Conjecture on number 21 is true
 23=1+3+19, Conjecture on number 23 is true
 25=1+1+23, Conjecture on number 25 is true
 27=1+3+23, Conjecture on number 27 is true
 29=1+5+23, Conjecture on number 29 is true
 31=1+1+29, Conjecture on number 31 is true
 33=1+1+31, Conjecture on number 33 is true
```

And when I input 100000, it take a so long time that I can not wait the answer showing.

## What is this?

Ok, to be honest, this is just a few lines of codes to practice myself.
